# PsychPhil
A Django based web-app that connects clients to therapists. This is a personal project/concept for a business.

An app where people seeking psychotherapy can connect to a therapist. The app has basic users (clients), users who have some special CRUD permissions (therapists)
and staff (Admins) who can accept or reject clients who apply to become therapists and have full CRUD permissions. Therapists can creat theraputic schools and join them,
thereby offering their services to clients.

NOTE: Project is ready but improvements are needed in both code and functionality. Functionality testing needs to be created. The project will be deployed soon.

Backend: Django with 7+ models with all three kinds of relationships applied; class and function based views; 
customized forms; customized user and login/register/logout functionality; public and private part for web-app; customized admin site. Integration testing applied on views with data from DB. 

Frontend: made with Django templates (HTML & CSS).

Experience gained with: Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, classes and objects, class hierarchies, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism;
iterators and generators, decorators, unit-testing, integration testing, SOLID Principles, SSR, etc.
